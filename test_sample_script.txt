INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

SARAH sits at a corner table, typing furiously on her laptop. The morning rush creates a gentle buzz around her.

She pauses, looking up from the screen with uncertainty in her eyes.

SARAH
(to herself)
This has to work.

The BARISTA approaches with a fresh cup of coffee.

BARISTA
Another refill?

SARAH
(grateful)
You're a lifesaver.

EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

Sarah exits the coffee shop, laptop bag slung over her shoulder. She walks with purpose down the busy sidewalk.

A BUSINESSMAN bumps into her, nearly knocking her laptop bag to the ground.

BUSINESSMAN
Sorry! Didn't see you there.

SARAH
(steadying herself)
No problem.

She continues walking, more cautiously now.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

Sarah approaches the reception desk. The RECEPTIONIST looks up with a professional smile.

RECEPTIONIST
How can I help you?

SARAH
I have a meeting with Mr. Johnson at 10 AM.

The receptionist checks her computer screen.

RECEPTIONIST
Sarah Mitchell?

SARAH
That's me.

RECEPTIONIST
Take the elevator to the 15th floor. Conference room B.

Sarah nods and heads toward the elevators.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM B - DAY

Sarah enters a modern conference room with floor-to-ceiling windows. MR. JOHNSON, a distinguished man in his 50s, stands at the head of a long table.

MR. JOHNSON
Sarah! Thanks for coming in.

SARAH
Thank you for seeing me, Mr. Johnson.

They shake hands professionally.

MR. JOHNSON
Please, have a seat. I've reviewed your proposal.

Sarah sits down, placing her laptop on the table.

SARAH
I believe this project could revolutionize how we approach the market.

MR. JOHNSON
Interesting perspective. Tell me more.
