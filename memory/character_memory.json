Her only accessory is a silver locket, which hangs from a chain around her neck. N A's overall vibe is that of a mysterious, strong, and determined woman who isn't afraid to face any challenge.",
  "Bhaskar": "Bhaskar is a middle-aged man of Indian ethnicity, with a sturdy build and an imposing stature. His deep-set, almond-shaped eyes are of a warm, dark brown shade, radiating wisdom and kindness. Crow's feet at the corners suggest years of hearty laughter. Jet black hair streaked with strands of silver, combed back neatly, complements his sun-kissed, slightly wrinkled complexion. He sports a well-groomed beard, peppered with grey, which gives him a dignified look. He is usually seen in a traditional Indian kurta in earthy tones, paired with cream cotton pants, and a pair of worn, brown leather sandals. A golden wristwatch encircles his robust wrist. A pair of round, wire-rimmed glasses rests on his broad nose, and he carries an aura of serenity and intellect. His overall vibe is that of a learned, approachable scholar with deep-rooted cultural pride.",
  "Milkman": "Milkman is a lanky middle-aged male character with a charmingly weather-beaten face that bears testament to his long years in the sun. His twinkling, vibrant green eyes, nestled under bushy salt-and-pepper eyebrows, sparkle with mischief and kindness. A bushy mustache, the same mix of black and white, hangs over his thin lips. His hair, a wild, unkempt mop of silver curls, adds to his spirited personality. Dressed in a classic white button-down shirt, rolled up to his elbows, and a pair of faded denim jeans held up by a sturdy leather belt, he exudes a rugged yet endearing vibe. A worn-out straw hat is perennially perched atop his head, shielding his eyes from the sun. His large, calloused hands are a testament to his hardworking nature. A pair of well-worn brown boots complete the ensemble, making Milkman a unique mix of a traditional milkman and a contemporary hero."
