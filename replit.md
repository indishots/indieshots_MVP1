# IndieShots - Screenplay to Shot List Converter

## Overview

IndieShots is a full-stack web application that converts screenplay scripts into structured shot lists using AI-powered analysis. The application is designed for independent filmmakers and content creators to streamline their pre-production workflow by automatically extracting scenes, characters, locations, and other production elements from scripts.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with a React frontend and Express.js backend, both written in TypeScript. The architecture is designed for simplicity and rapid development while maintaining scalability.

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Multiple providers (Firebase, JWT, OAuth)
- **File Processing**: Multer for uploads with DOCX/TXT support
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 for script parsing

## Key Components

### Authentication System
The application supports multiple authentication methods:
- Firebase Authentication for Google OAuth
- JWT-based local authentication
- Session-based authentication with PostgreSQL storage
- Demo mode for development and testing

**Rationale**: Multiple auth providers ensure flexibility for different user preferences while Firebase provides reliable OAuth integration.

### File Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: Multer handles file uploads with validation
2. **Processing**: Text extraction from DOCX/TXT files
3. **Parsing**: AI-powered analysis using OpenAI GPT-4
4. **Export**: XLSX/CSV generation for shot lists

**Security**: File validation uses magic bytes and extension whitelisting (OWASP recommended).

### Database Design
- **Users**: Stores user profiles, subscription tiers, and usage quotas
- **Scripts**: File metadata and content storage
- **Parse Jobs**: Background job tracking with status updates
- **Sessions**: Session storage for authentication

**Choice**: PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance and JSON support for flexible data structures.

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration/Login**: Authentication through multiple providers
2. **Script Upload**: File validation and text extraction
3. **Column Selection**: User chooses data fields to extract
4. **AI Processing**: Background job processes script with OpenAI
5. **Review & Export**: User reviews results and downloads formatted output

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 API for intelligent script parsing
- **Firebase**: Authentication services (optional)
- **SendGrid**: Email services for notifications
- **Neon**: PostgreSQL database hosting

### Security Considerations
- CSRF protection disabled for development (to be enabled in production)
- File upload validation using magic bytes
- JWT token management with secure cookies
- Environment variable protection for API keys

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Platform**: Replit with PostgreSQL module
- **Port Configuration**: Application runs on port 5000
- **Auto-deployment**: Configured for Replit's autoscale deployment

### Build Process
1. Frontend build with Vite (outputs to `dist/public`)
2. Backend build with esbuild (outputs to `dist`)
3. Static file serving from Express

### Environment Variables Required
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=openai_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=firebase_api_key (optional)
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=firebase_project_id (optional)
